css style 
- for each chart in the card, make it resizable 

layout
- included KPI 
- try to put the description (general highlight ) say the percentage 
- side by side?
    - left: the title, descripton, KPI 
    - right: the map 
- just an idea: for side by side, one side have 2 cards, 1 card saying the 
highlight adn the other one say how to use this chart, the right side is the chart

ALSO add keypoint/ highlight for each graph 


map
- resize the percentage 
- two filter for time 
    - one is year 
    - one is quarter ( default to be Q1)
- because the data isnt changing much, consider to have year (default quarter) instead? 
    only shows all quarter (in period) for the trend 

stack bar

trend
- change the dependence to be period
- show both the period adn quarter in the tooltip
- add a time slider depended on the period 
- make sure it is not just using the Q1 data 
- gride line by quarter instead of the default one
